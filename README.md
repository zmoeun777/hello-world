Hello Everyone.

I would like to introduce myself to the programming community. I have been doing IT work for over 3 years and now I have finally decided to commit myself in learning how to be a programmer. Let us work together and become better in our respective fields. I appreciate any advice that you are able to provide. Thank you for your time.
